# 🧠 Minimal Autodiff Engine (From Scratch)

This repository contains my implementation of:

- 🔁 Forward-Mode Automatic Differentiation (Dual Numbers)
- 🔄 Reverse-Mode Automatic Differentiation (Backpropagation)
- 🧮 2-Layer MLP built using the autodiff engine

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to deeply understand:

- Chain rule
- Gradient propagation
- Computation graphs
- Backpropagation
- How frameworks like PyTorch work internally

Everything is implemented from scratch using pure Python.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project

Instead of using ML libraries, this project focuses on:

Understand → Implement → Verify → Document

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- math module
- numpy (for MLP if used)
